Marilyn Monroe Andy Warhol Recreation with K-Means Clustering

This project recreates Andy Warhol’s iconic Marilyn Monroe pop art style by applying K-Means color clustering to an image of Marilyn Monroe. The goal of the project is to transform a regular photograph into a stylized, posterized version with bold, flat colors reminiscent of Warhol’s aesthetic.

🎨 Project Overview

Andy Warhol’s Marilyn Monroe prints are known for their vibrant, simplified color palettes. This project uses unsupervised learning—specifically K-Means clustering—to achieve a similar effect by reducing the image to a fixed number of dominant colors.

K-Means groups pixels based on color similarity and replaces each pixel with its cluster center (mean color), resulting in a reduced palette and a pop-art look.

🧠 Key Concepts

Image preprocessing: loading and reshaping images for clustering

K-Means clustering: grouping pixel colors into 
𝑘
k clusters

Color quantization: reducing the number of unique colors in an image

Artistic stylization: adjusting 
𝑘
k to achieve bold or detailed effects
